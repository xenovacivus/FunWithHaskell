FunWithHaskell
==============

Just having some fun with Haskell

rpn.hs
------

You'll probably need Haskell installed to have any fun here: http://www.haskell.org/platform/.

Then, Open your favorite terminal, go to where this file exists and do the following:

```bash
ghci
```
```haskell
:l rpn.hs
parse_rpn_list ["1", "1", "+", "1", "+", "1.2", "/"]
```
